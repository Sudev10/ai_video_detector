# AI Video Authenticity Detector (WIP)

This project attempts to detect AI-generated or highly stabilized synthetic videos by analyzing frame-to-frame edge smoothness and temporal consistency.

## Status
🚧 Currently Under Development

## Features Implemented
- Frame extraction (OpenCV)
- Edge strength computation
- Consistency scoring metric

## Sample Output
Frames analyzed: 39
Consistency Score: 0.49

## Roadmap / TODO
- [x] Basic pipeline
- [ ] Improve scoring metrics
- [ ] Evaluate dataset samples
- [ ] Visualization dashboard
- [ ] Web frontend (optional)

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Future Idea
Eventually include ML-based video forensic models for deepfake & AI content detection.
